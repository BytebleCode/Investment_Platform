## Understanding Returns

### Unrealized vs Realized Gains

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Unrealized** | Profit/loss on stocks you still own |
| **Realized** | Profit/loss from stocks you've sold |

Only **realized gains** are taxable.

### Tax Calculation

The platform calculates estimated tax at **37%** (short-term capital gains rate):

```
Estimated Tax = Realized Gains x 0.37
```

Example:
- Realized Gains: $5,000
- Estimated Tax: $5,000 x 0.37 = $1,850

### Return Calculation

```
Total Return = (Current Portfolio Value - Initial Value) / Initial Value x 100%

Where:
Current Portfolio Value = Cash + Sum(Holdings Value)
Initial Value = $100,000 (default)
```
